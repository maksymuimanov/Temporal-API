# Temporal API

Welcome to the **Temporal API Wiki** - the official wiki for the **Temporal API** Minecraft modding framework.

**Temporal API** is a framework designed to simplify the whole development process by reducing boilerplate and letting modders focus only on unique features. It does **not add gameplay features to players directly** - it exists to help **mod developers** deliver content faster. It provides utilities, abstractions, and extension points to streamline mod development on **NeoForge** (currently only NeoForge).

## Core Purpose

The main goal of Temporal API is to **make creating Minecraft mods easier and more flexible**.

It provides foundational systems such as:
- Object Factories

- Event Handlers
- Annotation Processors

- Simplified Datagen using Annotations
- Automated Registries and Events
- And much more

All of these aim to **reduce repetitive code and complexity** for mod developers.
